creating a more visually appealing and effective SOC dashboard, here are some "storyboard" frames that illustrate the concept, from a calm state to a critical incident.

**Frame 1: The Calm Before the Storm**

This image represents the default state of the dashboard. It's clean, minimalist, and designed for at-a-glance clarity. The focus is on the overall network health, with subtle visual cues to guide the analyst's attention.

**Frame 2: A Critical Alert**

This frame shows the dynamic, immediate change when a high-severity threat is detected. The interface changes to draw the eye to the critical event, making it impossible to miss.

**Frame 3: Focused Investigation**

Once the alert is acknowledged, the dashboard pivots to an investigative view. The focus is now on the specific incident, presenting all relevant context and actionable data without clutter.
